<!-- Challenge 1:
. Create a function named greaterThanSize that has the following requirements:
● Takes no parameters
● Calculates a random local variable named size
● Does a while loop that does the following
○ increments a counter by one
○ output the current size and counter
○ continues until the counter is greater than the size
● The output will be different every time, because the size number will be different
